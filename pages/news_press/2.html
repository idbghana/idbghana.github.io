					<h3>IDB Ghana receives licence from Bank of Ghana</h3><img src="../../img/news/thumb/resized/the_royal_bank_license.png" alt="The Royal Bank" /><div class="description">Dr. K. K. Sarpong (right), receives the banking licence from The Bank of Ghana on behalf of IDB Ghana.</div><br /><p>
	IDB Ghana, the latest Bank to be registered by the Bank of Ghana, was yesterday formally presented with its Universal Banking Licence by the Central Bank.<br />
	<br />
	By this IDB Ghana becomes the 26th Bank and 14th domestic bank to be registered to operate in the country.<br />
	With the acquisition of its universal banking licence, IDB Ghana is set to officially commence business on Monday December 10, 2014.<br />
	<br />
	Speaking at a short ceremony before the presentation of the licence, the Head of Banking Supervision at the Bank of Ghana, Franklin Belnye , commended the bank for meeting all the requirements of the Bank of Ghana, leading to the granting of the licence.<br />
	<br />
	He was happy that the licensing of IDB Ghana has increased the number of domestic banks in the sector, adding that the presence of more domestic banks and local content was good for meeting the needs of the local players and stakeholders.<br />
	<br />
	According to him, &quot;though there are a number of international banks operating in the country there was the need for an increase in domestic banks so that the needs of the locals would be taken care of in a bigger way.&quot;<br />
	<br />
	He expressed the hope that IDB Ghana would take an interest in the agric sector and help it grow since over the years the sector has not seen much sup- port from the banking industry.<br />
	<br />
	Coming into the industry with a capital base of about GHS 100million, he was optimistic that though the terrain was very competitive, IDB Ghana was ready for the challenge and promised that the Bank of Ghana was ready to offer all the necessary assistance to the new bank to succeed in the industry.<br />
	<br />
	The Head of the Banking Supervision Department asked officials of IDB Ghana to ensure that they played by the rules and regulations of the industry.<br />
	<br />
	The chairman of IDB Ghana, Dr. K. K. Sarpong, who received the licence on behalf of the Bank, said it was ready to play by the rules and regulations of the industry and expressed his gratitude to the Bank of Ghana for the support.<br />
	<br />
	He said in every economy where there was financial deepening as it is in Ghana today there was competition and with the entry of IDB Ghana, with a capital base almost double the minimum capital requirement by the Bank of Ghana, the bank was ready for the competition.<br />
	<br />
	He said the hallmarks of IDB Ghana would be honesty, passion, integrity and competitive pricing of financial products adding that visionaries of IDB Ghana believe that there is the need for a radical approach to pricing of financial products.<br />
	<br />
	&quot;We are here to improve efficiency and the best of prices backed by excellent service, &quot;adding that with its universal banking licence the bank would venture into any sector that needs to be looked at.<br />
	<br />
	He said the bank had very competent staff who will be guided by an equally competent board to steer the affairs of the bank as it strives&nbsp;to ensure good governance, healthy competition and efficiency.<br />
